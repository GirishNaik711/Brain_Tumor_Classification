# CodeClauseInternship_Brain_Tumor_Classification

ABSTRACT:
Brain tumors are aggressive diseases affecting both children and adults, comprising 85-90% of primary Central Nervous System tumors. Each year, about 11,700 people are diagnosed, with a 5-year survival rate of 34% for men and 36% for women. They are categorized as benign, malignant, pituitary, etc. Early diagnosis through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial. Automated classification with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, particularly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL), is more accurate than manual methods, offering a promising solution for global medical use.

TASK:
To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

DATA DESCRIPTION:

The dataset contains 3 folders: yes, no and pred which contains 3060 Brain MRI Images.
Yes:	The folder yes contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous
No:	The folder no contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous
